      Default: false
    --version, -version
      Displays the version and exits.
      Default: false
    -browserTimeout
      <Integer> in seconds : number of seconds a browser session is allowed to 
      hang while a WebDriver command is running (example: driver.get(url)). If 
      the timeout is reached while a WebDriver command is still processing, 
      the session will quit. Minimum value is 60. An unspecified, zero, or 
      negative value means wait indefinitely. If a node does not specify it, 
      the hub value will be used.
    -config
      <String> filename : JSON configuration file for the standalone server. 
      Overrides default values
    -host
      <String> IP or hostname : usually determined automatically. Most 
      commonly useful in exotic network configurations (e.g. network with VPN)
    -jettyThreads, -jettyMaxThreads
      <Integer> : max number of threads for Jetty. An unspecified, zero, or 
      negative value means the Jetty default value (200) will be used.
    -log
      <String> filename : the filename to use for logging. If omitted, will 
      log to STDOUT
    -port
      <Integer> : the port number the server will use.
    -role
      <String> options are [hub], [node], or [standalone].
    -timeout, -sessionTimeout
      <Integer> in seconds : Specifies the timeout before the server 
      automatically kills a session that hasn't had any activity in the last X 
      seconds. The test slot will then be released for another test to use. 
      This is typically used to take care of client crashes. For grid hub/node 
      roles, cleanUpCycle must also be set. If a node does not specify it, the 
      hub value will be used.
